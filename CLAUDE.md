# Glen's Development Standards

## IDENTITY

You are working in Glen Barnhardt's development environment. Glen is a 67-year-old software engineer with 40+ years experience who operates as an "AI Agentic Engineer" - directing AI systems rather than writing code manually.

**Philosophy:** "If you find a bug, document and fix it" - never say "that error was not part of current changes."

---

## ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Git Workflow
1. **NEVER work directly on main branch**
2. **NEVER commit to main** - Only merge via approved PRs
3. All branches: `feature/{issue}-{slug}` or `fix/{issue}-{slug}`
4. Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
5. Create GitHub issues for ALL work before starting
6. Use git worktrees for isolation: `../worktrees/feature-{issue}-{slug}`

### Code Quality
1. **NEVER use TypeScript `any`** - Use `unknown` + type guards
2. **NEVER use `!` (non-null assertion)** without documented justification
3. **ALL function parameters and returns explicitly typed**
4. **ALL errors typed and handled** - No swallowed errors
5. **If you encounter ANY bug: FIX IT** - Yours or pre-existing

### Configuration Protection
1. **NEVER modify test files to make tests pass** - Fix the code
2. **NEVER modify configs to suppress errors** - tsconfig, biome are protected
3. **NEVER change `strict` settings** in TypeScript
4. **NEVER add biome-ignore** without explicit approval

### Agent Behavior
1. **Orchestrator NEVER writes code** - Delegates only
2. **Test-runner is READ-ONLY** - Cannot modify files
3. **After 3 failures: STOP and escalate**
4. **Check memory MCP** before starting work
5. **Save decisions to memory MCP** during work

## WORKFLOW

### Starting Work
1. Check memory: "What do I know about this project?"
2. Read codebase-map skill if available
3. Create/reference GitHub issue
4. Create feature branch in worktree
5. Never work in main repo during implementation

### During Work
1. Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` after every edit
2. Run `pnpm biome check` after every edit
3. Commit atomically - small, focused commits
4. Save progress to memory periodically

### Completing Work
1. Run full test suite: `pnpm test`
2. Fix ALL errors (not just yours)
3. Create PR with proper description
4. Request review
5. Update memory with completion

---

## FAILURE PROTOCOL

When failures occur:
1. Document what was tried
2. Document error messages verbatim
3. Document hypothesis for cause
4. **After 3 attempts: STOP**
5. Escalate with full context
6. Do NOT retry indefinitely
7. Do NOT modify tests/configs to suppress errors

---

## MEMORY USAGE

Always interact with memory MCP:
- **Session start:** Load project context
- **Key decisions:** Save architectural choices
- **Task completion:** Save what was done
- **Failures:** Save what was tried
