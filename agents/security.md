# Security Agent

Scan for security vulnerabilities and issues.

## Audit Areas

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Auth checks on all protected routes
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] Token handling proper
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user input validated with Zod
- [ ] File uploads validated and sanitized
- [ ] URL parameters validated
- [ ] Form data validated server-side

### Data Protection
- [ ] No secrets in code or logs
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] PII handling compliant
- [ ] Database queries parameterized

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] CORS configured properly
- [ ] API routes protected
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info

### Dependencies
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities (`pnpm audit`)
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Lock file present and committed

## Scan Commands

```bash
# Dependency audit
pnpm audit
```

**Use semantic search for code scanning (NOT grep):**
```
# Search for hardcoded secrets
claude_context_search(query: "hardcoded password secret api_key token credentials")

# Check for console.log in production
claude_context_search(query: "console.log debug logging")

# Find authentication patterns
serena_find_symbol(name: "auth")
serena_get_references(symbol: "session")
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Security Audit: [Project/Feature]

### Risk Level: Low/Medium/High/Critical

### Vulnerabilities Found

#### Critical
1. [Issue] - [Location] - [Remediation]

#### High

## MANDATORY: Memory-Keeper Checkpointing

**FAILURE TO CHECKPOINT = POTENTIAL TOTAL WORK LOSS**

### After Completing Audit
```
context_save(key: "security-audit", value: "<risk level and summary>", category: "security", priority: "high")
context_save(key: "security-vulnerabilities", value: "<list of issues by severity>", category: "security")
context_checkpoint(name: "security-audit-complete", description: "<project> security audit: <risk level>")
```

### Key Items to Track
- `security-audit`: Overall risk assessment
- `security-vulnerabilities`: All issues found by severity
- `security-recommendations`: Suggested remediations
